# 1980s Horror Movie Analysis (IMDb Ratings)

This project analyzes the long-term cultural impact of 1980s horror films using modern IMDb user ratings. 
Because IMDb is a contemporary platform, the ratings reflect how today’s audiences perceive and evaluate 
horror films from the decade, many of which have undergone significant critical reassessment since their 
initial release. The goal of this project is to identify the ten highest-rated horror films of the 1980s 
according to modern viewers and to explore which cinematic qualities have allowed these films to endure.

## Findings

The final Top 10 list demonstrates how 1980s horror has aged in the eyes of modern viewers. The Shining stands firmly at the top, widely regarded as a psychological masterpiece whose influence continues to shape the genre. Films that initially received mixed reactions such as The Thing and The Evil Dead, have since undergone substantial critical reevaluation, rising to become some of the decade’s most celebrated works.

The ranking highlights a diverse range of horror styles, from psychological terror (The Shining, Possession) to creature effects (The Fly, The Thing) to supernatural classics (Poltergeist). These results show that the films with the strongest long-term reception are those that blended atmosphere, innovation, and memorable practical effects. This suggests that the 1980s remain a defining era for horror, with many films achieving greater appreciation decades after their theatrical debut.

## Methods

### **Data Source**
The dataset used (`IMDb Horror: Chilling Movie Dataset') contains movie titles, release years, genres, IMDb ratings, 
votes, runtime, directors, and gross revenue. The dataset reflects modern IMDb user ratings rather than 
1980s audience reactions.

### **Data Cleaning**
- Column names were normalized by converting all names to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.
- Numeric columns (`rating`, `votes`, `movie_year`) were converted using `pd.to_numeric` with coercion.
- Rows with invalid or missing release year values were removed for consistency.

### **Filtering and Subsetting**
- A horror-specific subset (`df_h`) was created by selecting rows where the `genre` field contained 
  the substring `"horror"`.
- A `decade` column was generated by flooring each release year to the nearest decade.
- Only films with `decade == 1980` were included for 1980s analysis.

### **Ranking Method**
- Films were ranked primarily by IMDb rating (descending).
- Vote count was used as a secondary sort to favor films with broader audience engagement.
- The Top 10 list reflects the highest-rated horror films of the decade according to modern user ratings.

### **Visualization**
Custom Matplotlib charts were created in Google Colab, including stylistic variants inspired by
1980s aesthetics (e.g., VHS video store, neon themes).

## Conclusion

This project shows that the 1980s remain one of the most influential eras in horror cinema. Films that were once polarizing or underappreciated have risen to the top through decades of reassessment, fan engagement, and the lasting impact of practical effects and bold storytelling. Modern IMDb ratings paint a picture of a decade defined by experimentation, atmosphere, and innovation qualities that continue to resonate with viewers today.
